# Nominal Roll Generator

A web based app designed to store personnel records and generate nominal rolls in PDF format for historical military units.

## Demo

A full working demo, with usage instructions, is available at <https://nominal-rolls.sasoriginals.com>

This app is designed to be deployed either on Docker infrastructure (using docker-compose), or on a Linux OS. Either way, the user is required to configure a mongoDB instance, using access credentials as may be defined in index.js.
